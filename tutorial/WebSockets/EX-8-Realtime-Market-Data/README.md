# Getting Realtime Market Data
The most interesting benefit of using the WebSocket client is getting access to data in real-time. Picking up where we left off in
EX-7, let's clear out our UI code, and all the things pertaining to the specifics of our test request. Navigate to EX-8 in your project
folder and run the typical `yarn install` to get your dependencies situated. You'll see we've stripped out all the specifics of the
EX-7 solution, leaving us with our reusable tools and giving us a clean slate to work with for our Market Data project.
