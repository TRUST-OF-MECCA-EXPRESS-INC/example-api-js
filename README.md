# example-api-js

This is a collection of example projects to get you started with the Tradovate API using JavaScript.

## Usage

You can clone this repository and follow along with each project. To run one of the tutorial projects,
first open a terminal and navigate to the specific tutorial folder you'd like to work from. Once you've navigated to your chosen tutorial 
project's root, install the dependencies:

```
> yarn install
```

Then follow along with the README guide located in the root of each project. When you're ready to run
a project run the following command:

```
> yarn start
```

Then open a browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`, and hack away.

> To make the more complicated examples more accessible, we've included 'Solution' folders with some of the projects. They can be opened and run just the same as any of the 
> other follow-along projects so that you can compare your work to the end results.
